Call Of Duty- Text Analysis Project

The Call of Duty League is an e-sports league based on Activision’s Call of Duty video game. At the moment the league has 13 teams each having large number of followers.
the marketing team representing the league want to add a new team called “Cleveland Fire”. The company has provided me with a large amoutn of data 
- 'teamTimeline' FOLDER - this file has one file with 26,781 tweets among 13 teams.
- 'playerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 13 files, one per team, totaling 177,764 tweets.  
- 'teamFollowerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 13 files, one per team, totally 361,440 tweets. This represents a sample of 3600 followers for each team among the followers.
- 'playerFollowerTimelines' FOLDER – contains 61 files, one per player, totally 2,006,995 tweets

The objective is to identify themes or insights that may benefit the company in adding a new team.

### In order to provide actionable insights and recomendations I used text mining processes through R-programming.
