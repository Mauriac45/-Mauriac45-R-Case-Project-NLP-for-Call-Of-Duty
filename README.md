## NBA- Text Analysis Project

  My role in this project was to think as a marketing analyst for NIKE, where I had to analyze fan engagement based on the fan's tweets or comments. 
By using NLP, more precisely text mining analysis, I was able to examine the fans' sentiment and polarity. In addition, I was able to learn about the most popular teams, comment about them, and even the most spoken about athletes.
  At the end of the analysis , I provided some insightsuch as frequent words, emerging topics, share of voice, sentiment/polarity by athlete, team, or across the NBA.
 These analysis supported my recommneded actionable insight.
